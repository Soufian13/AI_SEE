# SEE_Sentiment_Extraction_Experts

We would like to analyse and predict reviews based on the Kaggle project: https://www.kaggle.com/code/robikscube/sentiment-analysis-python-youtube-tutorial

The goal is to be able to perform a sentiment analysis with VADAR as well as with the pre-trained language model ROBERTA. In a further step, we would like to compare the results of the sentiment analysis with the star ratings and create a prediction model from both values. Since the star rating between 1 and 5 is a rather superficial evaluation model, we hope to arrive at a more precise prediction by combining the star rating and sentiment analysis.
