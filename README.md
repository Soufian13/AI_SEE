# SEE_Sentiment_Extraction_Experts

We would like to conduct a user analysis. We are focusing our analysis on data sets in which users were able to rate a product or service and leave a written review. Our model for predicting which other products or services might suit a user is based on two steps:
1. A sentiment analysis is created based on the written review in order to make it usable for the model.
2. We will then create a model (decision tree, neural network, random forest). The objective is to compare the effectiveness of the individual models with each other.
We have identified three suitable data sets. We will start with the smallest data set and then work our way up to larger and larger data sets, assuming that our model only needs to be adjusted slightly with each change.

We are using the following sources:
